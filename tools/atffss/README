ATF FSS : ATF File-System-Safe
==============================

ATF-FSS is a notation used for naming files with sign names or (most)
sign values in a forgiving way both for humans and the Unix shell.

The notation is very similar to the one used by OSL, and the lookup
table from ATF-FSS names to OIDs is derived from OSL's slmap.js with
the following modifications:

    * in OSL is x in ATF-FSS
    
    ' in OSL is disallowed in ATF-FSS--this means that sign values
    containing ' cannot be used in file-naming.

These changes mean that ATF-FSS file names do not need to be escaped or quoted.
